\title{Determine the Optimal Number of Tickets Sold Using Normal Approximation}
\usage{
optimal_n_continuous(N, p, gamma, n_range)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Capacity of the venue (maximum allowed attendees).}

\item{p}{Numeric. Probability a single ticket holder shows up (0 to 1).}

\item{gamma}{Numeric. Acceptable probability of exceeding capacity (e.g., 0.2).}

\item{n_range}{Numeric vector. Range of ticket values to evaluate (can be fractional, e.g., \code{seq(200, 220, 0.1)}).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The value of \code{n} within \code{n_range} that minimizes the absolute difference
from the target tail probability. A base R plot is also produced to visualize the results.
}
\description{
This function finds the optimal (possibly fractional) number of tickets to sell
such that the probability of exceeding capacity \code{N} is below a specified risk threshold \code{gamma}.
It uses the normal approximation to the binomial distribution with a 0.5 continuity correction,
evaluating the deviation between the desired confidence level and the approximated cumulative probability.
