# MATH4753KORBProject1

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MATH4753KORBProject1 is to support decision-making in overbooking scenarios using statistical modeling. This package provides tools to determine the optimal number of tickets to sell when there's a probability of no-shows—common in industries like airlines, hotels, and events.

It includes three core functions:

- optimal_n_discrete(): Uses a discrete distribution to compute the optimal number of overbooked reservations.
- optimal_n_continuous(): Applies a continuous approximation for efficiency in large-scale problems.
- optimal_n(): A user-friendly wrapper that powers an interactive Shiny app for visualizing and exploring the effects of parameter changes in real time.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MATH4753KORBProject1 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("kkorb21/MATH4753KORBProject1")
```

## Example

Here’s a simple example using the discrete method:

```{r example}
library(MATH4753KORBProject1)

optimal_n_discrete(N = 200, p = 0.95, gamma = 0.2, n_range = 200:220)
```

## Interactive Exploration

To explore these models interactively, launch the companion Shiny app powered by optimal_n():

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
